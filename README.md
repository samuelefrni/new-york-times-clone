## Overview

This project is a clone of the New York Times website, created by [samuelefrni](https://github.com/samuelefrni). It aims to replicate the design and functionality of the New York Times site for learning and practice purposes.

New York Times clone, my choice to undertake this project is guided by the belief that having access to high-quality news is of fundamental importance for good information.

The project was created with the aim of replicating the home page of the famous US newspaper.
